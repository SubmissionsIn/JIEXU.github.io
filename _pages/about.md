Hi, I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow in the Intelligent Machine Perception Lab leaded by Prof. [Na Zhao](https://impl2023.github.io/) in the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). I received my Ph.D. degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in Dec 2024, supervised by Prof. [Xiaofeng Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-bk1CrcAAAAJ&hl=en). Since 2023, I have been working closely with the RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (RIKEN-AIP)  mentored by Prof. [Gang Niu](https://niug1984.github.io/) and [Masashi Sugiyama](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GkYIrlIAAAAJ&hl=en). Before that, I received my B.Eng. degree from the UESTC in Jul 2020, supervised by Prof. [Yazhou Ren](https://yazhou-ren.github.io/).

I am currently working on multi-view machine learning and multi-view 3D computer vision. I am seeking extensive cooperation opportunities with self-motivated students and if you are interested in these topics, please feel free to contact me via email.
