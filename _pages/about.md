Hi~ I am a second-year PhD student at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), advised by [Xiaofeng Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-bk1CrcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), and currently a visiting PhD student at SUTD, advised by [Lei Feng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KomQOFkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). I worked as a research intern at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA).

I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow in the Intelligent Machine Perception Lab leaded by Prof.~\href{https://impl2023.github.io/}{\underline{Na Zhao}} in the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD).
I received my Ph.D. degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in Dec 2024, supervised by Prof.~[Xiaofeng Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-bk1CrcAAAAJ&hl=en).
Since 2023 to 2024, I have been working closely with the RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (RIKEN-AIP)  mentored by Prof.~[Masashi Sugiyama](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GkYIrlIAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Gang Niu](https://niug1984.github.io/).
Before that, I received my B.Eng. degree from the UESTC in Jul 2020, supervised by Prof.~[Yazhou Ren](https://yazhou-ren.github.io/).

I am currently working on multi-view machine learning and multi-view computer vision. If you are interested in these topics, please feel free to contact me via email and I am seeking extensive cooperation opportunities.
